    2. Python Classes and Linked Lists
    3. Arrays | Stacks | Queues | Strings
    4. Binary Search Trees and hash Tables
    5. Insertion Sort | merge Sort | Divide and Conquer
    6. QuickSort | Partition | Average case Complexities
    7. Recursion | Backtracking | Dynamic Programing
    8. Knapsack | Subsequence | matrix Problems
    9. Graphs | Breath-First Search | Depth First Search10. Shortest paths | Spanning Trees | Topological Sorting
    11. Disjoint Sets | Union Find Algorithm
